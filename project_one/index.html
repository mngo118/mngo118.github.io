        <h2>Hi I'm Myan!</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior at Eastside Preparatory School. I love baking, it's one of my favorite pass times and a great stress relief. I even baked my own birthday cake (to the side) I didn't ice the whole thing because I was going for a more naked cake look.My
            favorite thing to cook is cheesecake. In the "Recipes" page I'll put my go to recipes</p>
        <p>I'm trying to go to college somewhere in California or UW and study computer science or computer engineering. My second choice major is biology, but that's if I don't get into ANY CS programs. I'm also going to minor in Mandarin or Japanese (already
            studied) or maybe double major with CS and linquistics or something in that nature</p>
        <p>Over the past few summers I started hiking. My cousin and her husband are super "outdoor-sy" people, so when my sister and I stayed with them during two summers ago it was only natural that we'd pick it up too. This picture to the side is when
            we hiked up our first major mountain</p>
